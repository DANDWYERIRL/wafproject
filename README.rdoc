As the name suggests this was a submission for my web applicaitons framework project.

It was constructed using Ruby on Rails and was designed so that the user would input a location via google maps and the
application would calculate the nearest Irish Rail Train station to the location that was clicked.

This Functionality was created as a Ruby gem and is available for download as a gem at https://rubygems.org/gems/RailCalc
or can be installed via "gem install RailCalc"
